# React

- Javascript library to build Frontend/Ul Components in a web page

## Library vs Framework
- Framework will give all tools for development and testing
- Any change in application should be done with framework
- Library is just a supporting software

- create-react-app (Dev environment)

- Development tools in react is optional
- But since it helps, almost everyone uses it.

- Single Page Application (SPA)
  - Templating
  - Client-side Data Management
